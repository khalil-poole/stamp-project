My overall design approach was to not only emulate the design as close as 
possible with my ongoing skill set, but to write clear and concise code with practices such as
BEM (Block Element Modifier) where applicable, implement visual quality of life flair for customers,
and reuse code where applicable to save the dev team time.

Some issues that I look forward to seeing what can be implemented to fix and be much more readable for other devs in the team.

*Font Awesome Icon in the Form*

I utilized the show/hide password functionality with JavaScript, however I am interested to see
how I can change the font awesome icon from the cross out eye, until the non crossed eye in JS. 
I also for some reason was unable to figure out how to make the font of the placeholder text to be white.

In the design folder, there is the png files that show the landing page. I was having some difficulty with the placeholder text
as I am unable to have the words "Sign up" followed by the chevron icon to show up on my version of
the landing page. I am curious if there is a way to insert font awesome icons inside the input submit type.

*CSS Line 152*

I am confident that there is a more efficent way of having this displayed 
towards the left side of the page rather than hardcoding to match the positioning 
with my approach. I would love to hear suggestions for better efficiency!

*CSS Line 173*

I attempted to apply a white color for the placeholder font, however I am only able to get a gray color,
even after playing around with the other classes associated with the form.
how would the team approach this problem and what solutions could be determined?

*CSS Line 293*

My approach to removing excess space between the two paragraps
and the form was to apply 0 margin, however I was unable to do so.
Will positioning with relative/absolute work?


*CSS Line 313*

My approach was to have the copyright and footer links be displayed vertically for mobile
devices. I was not able to implement this, and did the best I could. I would like to see what
I could've approved on to not make the same mistake when working with teams.
